# Stanislavus OKR Tree

An OKR (Objectives and Key Results) management application with a hierarchical tree view and interactive graph mode.

Built with Flask + SQLite + Bootstrap 5, served via Docker Compose (uvicorn + nginx). Features user authentication with role-based access control.

## Features

### 📋 Hierarchical View
Explore your OKR tree in a familiar nested list. Expand/collapse key results, track progress with color-coded bars, see team assignments and responsible managers at a glance.

### 🔍 Filtering & Search
Quickly narrow down objectives by team or manager. Use the real-time text search to find specific objectives or key results across the entire tree.

### 🕸️ Interactive Graph Mode
Switch to a visual tree view with SVG connection lines that reveal the parent-child relationships between objectives. Pan the canvas by dragging with your mouse.

### ✏️ Edit Mode
Enable edit mode to create, edit, reorder, and delete objectives and key results. Drag-and-drop to restructure the tree. Manage teams and managers in dedicated reference panels.

### 🔐 Role-Based Access
Three built-in roles — `view`, `edit`, and `admin` — control who can see, modify, or manage users. A first-run setup wizard creates the initial administrator account.

### ⚡ Automated KR Updates
Update key results programmatically via Bearer token authentication. KRs updated through the API are automatically marked with a 🤖 robot icon and tooltip in the UI.

### 🐳 Docker-Ready
One command to start: `docker compose up -d`. Data persists in SQLite, static files are served by nginx, environment variables let you customize branding and timezone.

```

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:5000

## Local Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Set `FLASK_ENV=development` for Flask debug mode (auto-reload disabled — restart manually).

## Docker Compose

| Service | Role | Image | Port |
|---------|------|-------|------|
| `app` | Flask app via uvicorn | custom (built) | 5000 (internal) |
| `nginx` | Reverse proxy, static files | nginx:alpine | 5000 → 80 |

Data is persisted in `./data/okr.db` (bind mount at `/data`).

## Configuration

| Variable | Default       | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `OKR_DB_PATH` | `data/okr.db` | SQLite database path |
| `COMPANY_NAME` | `Company`     | Company name displayed in the UI title and heading |
| `APP_HOST` | `http://localhost:5000` | Public URL of the application (used in generated curl snippets) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | auto-generated | Flask session signing key (set for production) |
| `TZ` | `Etc/UTC` | Container timezone (e.g. `Europe/Moscow`, `America/New_York`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `` (empty) | Comma-separated allowed origins for CORS, e.g. `http://localhost:3000,https://app.example.com`. When set, the server responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and related headers. |

### Usage examples

```bash
# Run with custom branding and timezone
COMPANY_NAME=MyCorp TZ=Europe/Moscow docker compose up -d

# Or via .env file
# echo "COMPANY_NAME=MyCorp" >> .env
# echo "TZ=Europe/Moscow" >> .env
# docker compose up -d
```

## First-Run Setup

On first launch, when no users exist in the database, the application redirects to `/setup`, where an initial administrator account must be created. After setup, all users must authenticate via `/login`.

## Access Control

Three roles are supported:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `view` | Read-only access to the OKR tree |
| `edit` | View + create/edit/delete objectives, key results, teams, and managers |
| `admin` | Full access + user management (create/edit/delete users, change roles) |

- Role assignment is managed exclusively by administrators.
- Users can change their own password via the profile dropdown in the top-right corner.

## OpenAPI Specification (Manifest First)

The application follows a **Manifest First** approach: all `/api/*` endpoints are
defined in the [openapi.json](openapi.json) file and auto-registered at startup by
Connexion. The specification is also served at [/openapi.json](/openapi.json) for
external consumption, and an interactive **Swagger UI** is available at
[/api/docs](/api/docs) (requires login).

Responses that return collections are wrapped in an object
(e.g. `{"teams": [...]}` instead of a bare array).

## External Integrations

Updating Key Results from external sources (monitoring dashboards, CI/CD pipelines, CRM systems, etc.) is one of the core features of the application — it keeps the tree always reflecting the current state.
